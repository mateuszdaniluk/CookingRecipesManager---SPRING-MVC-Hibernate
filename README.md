PS. in second commit the AOP was added. just simple @Before and @AfterReturning with logging some infos about arguments etc.

PS. project is build without maven - it is because I had some internet connection problem while developing the app and all libraries was downloaded at my friends house and I make reference to them at my local hard drive.
